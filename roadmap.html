    <br>
    <p>There are many questions that come to the mind of anyone new to the world of data science and they are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What is Data Science?</li>
        <li>where do I start?</li>
        <li>What techniques do I need to master?</li> 
        <li>How can I become good in this field?</li>

    <h1 style="padding-top: 20px;">What is Data Science ?</h1>
            <img src="https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/what-is-data-science-1.jpg" class="cc" alt="">
            <p>Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, 
                derive meaningful information, and make business decisions.
                Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.                                                  The data used for analysis can come from many different sources and are presented in various formats.</p>
    <h1>where do I start?</h1>
    <p>
        How do I start? <br>
        Here we will help you how to get started and my roadmap will help you how to get started and will make it easy for you a lot
        A roadmap is a way to help you find out what you will be studying as a data science student.
        It will tell you the names of the topics that interest you and will start with them.
    </p>
    <h1>What techniques do I need to master?</h1>
    <p>Through the roadmap it will show you what technologies you should study, stay focused with us</p>
    <h1>How can I become good in this field?</h1>
    <p>
        Anything in life requires time, patience, diligence, and self-discipline.
        In order to become creative in this field, you have to persevere and continue and not give up.
        constant training, solving many problems, and working on many projects, you will become a good person in this field.
        All you need is patience and taking the right path to reach the top ❤️

    <hr>
    <p>Now we will make a brief explanation of every part of our roadmap : </p>
    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <img src="https://tl360.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Free-tutorial-websites-to-learn-how-to-code-696x387.jpg" class="cc" alt="">
    <h3>Which programming language is best for data science?</h3>
    <p>
        1.Python <br>
        2.R 
     </p>
    <h2>Statistics and mathematics</h2>
    <img src="https://leverageedublog.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/24201930/What-is-the-difference-between-Mathematics-and-Statistics_.jpg" class="cc" alt="">
    <h3>what is the use of statistics and mathematics in data science?</h3>
    <p>
        Statistics and mathematics is used to process complex problems in the real world
        so that Data Scientists and Analysts can look for meaningful trends and changes in Data.
        In simple words, Statistics and mathematics can be used to derive meaningful insights from data by performing mathematical computations on it.
    </p>
    <h2>Data extraction</h2>
    <img src="https://research.aimultiple.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Major-Benefits-of-Outsourcing-Data-Conversion-Services.jpg" class="cc" alt="">
    <p>Data extraction is the process of collecting or retrieving disparate types of data from a variety of sources, many of which may be poorly organized or completely unstructured.</p>
    <h2>Data wrangling - also called data cleaning</h2>
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/erainnovator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Data-Wrangling.png?resize=930%2C620&ssl=1" class="cc" alt="">
    <p>is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.
        Data analysts typically spend the majority of their time in the process of data wrangling compared to the actual analysis of the data.
        </p>
    <h2>Data engineering</h2>
    <img src="https://lirp.cdn-website.com/599c5dd6/dms3rep/multi/opt/Data+Science+Banner-01-640w.jpg" class="cc" alt="">
    <p>Data engineering is the practice of designing and building systems for collecting, storing, and analyzing data at scale</p>
    <h2>EDA,Business acumen and storytelling</h2>
    <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
    <img src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/EDA/EDA_1.png" class="cc" alt="">
    <p>is an approach to analyzing the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, and patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.</p>
    <h3>Business acumen</h3>
    <img src="https://www.insperity.com/wp-content/uploads/Business-acumen-1200-630.png" class="cc" alt="">
    <p>is someone's ability to understand business issues. It is the collection of both general and organization-specific knowledge about how things get done and why. It is a key characteristic of leadership and shows up in the questions someone asks and the decisions they make</p>
    <h3>Storytelling</h3>
    <img src="https://blog.graduateadmissions.wvu.edu/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog_Images/WVU%20Storytelling%20Infographic-min.png?width=600&name=WVU%20Storytelling%20Infographic-min.png" class="cc" alt="">
    <p>is the ability to effectively communicate insights from a dataset using narratives and visualizations. It can be used to put data insights into the context and inspire action from your audience.</p>
    <h2>Machine learning</h2>
    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*c_fiB-YgbnMl6nntYGBMHQ.jpeg" class="cc" alt="">
    <p>Machine Learning basically automates the process of Data Analysis and makes data-informed predictions in real-time without any human intervention. A Data Model is built automatically and further trained to make real-time predictions. </p>
