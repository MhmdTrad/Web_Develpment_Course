# Web_Develpment_Course
This semester, I have taken a web development course at my Uni. (BAU), and we were asked as students to create a simple website using the tools we studied, Actually, I build a website with the main goal of guiding students, especially those who are in the first year of data science, I used several tools for this project PHP, HTML, CSS, and Laragon environment.  

A lot of questions come to mind for anyone who is new to the field of data science. such as,
what is data science?
Where I should start?
What are the sources that I can learn from?
How can I become good in this field? and ...etc.
There are many, many questions.
Therefore, I designed a simple, clear, and uncomplicated website in a web programming course at my university(BAU), and this is my project for it.
In the beginning, the name of the site is 'Student Assistant For Data Science Department', and the idea of ​​the site is that it acts as a guide for new students in the field of data science by providing two pages; The first is the roadmap related to the specialization, which explains what the specialization is and what it includes from topics, and I made a simple and brief explanation of everything. And the second page is a 'Topics We Offer', and the idea is that I provide several sources, whether from the Internet or from YouTube, for specific topics such as, (Python language, data analysis, machine learning..etc) which will help the student, whether he is new or lost on the road of Data science to knows where to start.
